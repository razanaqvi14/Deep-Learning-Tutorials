Derivatives

- Derivatives are used for non-linear equations

- Example;

Derivative of x^3 is 3x^2
Derivative of 7x^3 is 21x^2
Derivative of 2x^3 + x^5 is 6x^2 + 5x^4

- Slope is used for linear equations whereas derivative is used for non-linear equations

- Slope is constant whereas derivative is a function

Partial Derivatives

let suppose you have to find out the partial derivative of f(x, y) = x^3 + y^2

the derivative of x^3 + y^2 w.r.t x will be;
partial derivative(f) / partial derivative(x) = 3x^2 + 0, you don't count y

the derivative of x^3 + y^2 w.r.t y will be;
partial derivative(f) / partial derivative(y) = 0 + 2y, you don't count x

How to actually find a derivative?

To find the derivative of a function y = f(x) we use the slope formula:

Slope = Change in Y / Change in X = Δy / Δx

we can say that;

x changes from x to	x + Δx
y changes from f(x) to f(x+Δx)

so the slope will be;

slope = (f(x + Δx) - f(x)) / ((x + Δx) - x)
